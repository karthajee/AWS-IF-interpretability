# Why, hello there!

This is the supporting notebook for the research paper — **Why Are You Weird? Infusing Interpretability in Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection** — published in the Explainable AI Workshop Proceedings of the 35th AAAI Conference, 2021. [Pre-print version is available on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06858).

Both commented code of the experiments and the results are reproduced at full in [the AWS_demo notebook](https://github.com/karthajee/AWS-IF-interpretability/blob/main/AWS_demo.ipynb). 

Since this is the first release of the implementation of the *Assist-Based Weighting Scheme (AWS)*, which powers our model-specific local explanation method for the Isolation Forest learner, we welcome all constructive feedback and suggestions.
